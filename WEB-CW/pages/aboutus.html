        <p>The job search function will work by entering a key word such as 'developer' or 'artist' into the input box
            and clicking on 'Display Results'. The site will then display 10 results that closely match what you
            entered. Using those results you will be able to get a SOC code for a specific job. With this SOC code, you
            scroll down to the next input box and enter the code here and proceed to click 'Display SOC Details'. This
            will display the relevant information about this specific job, which will then reveal another box to display
            a graph. This graph will have the average weekly pay for that job</p>
